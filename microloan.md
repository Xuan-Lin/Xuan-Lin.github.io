## Are Microloans Too Small?

I participated into this project as a research assistant under professor [Adam Osman](https://www.adam-osman.com/). The goal is to study how treatment effects of receiving microloans vary across individuals. Random forest was found to outperform other methods in terms of the significance of estimation. A significant heterogeneous treatment effect was found in monthly profits. I used R to implement machine learning models, including elastic net, random forest, boosting, and neural net. My tasks involved literature reviews, data cleaning, data visualization, model comparison, and report writing. I also set up Amazon Web Service EC2 Instances were set up to speed up analyses.
