## Testing Racial Disparities in Traffic Stops with Veil-of-darkness Method

This is a consulting project for the Urbana Police Department and the goal is to conduct a veil-of-darkness (VOD) analysis. VOD refers to the assumption that police suffer an impaired ability to detect motorists' race. The study focused on traffic stops made during the intertwilight period, where darkness events were used as the race-neutral benchmark, to test for any existence of racial profiling. I conducted literature reviews on past studies, used R for data preparation and running VOD analysis with logistic regression.
