## About me

I am a senior student majoring in Economics and Statistics at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), and I will be a graduate student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) starting from August 2020. I am currently a research assistant at [Illinois Risk Lab](https://irisklabuiuc.wixsite.com/actsi), and I worked as a teaching assistant in [applied machine learning](https://econml.web.illinois.edu/).

## Research Projects

#### Implied Portfolio Value-at-Risk: model-free and forward-looking risk estimates for investment portfolios

- The goal is to investigate how option data on the components of a portfolio can be employed to determine the Value-at-Risk of the investment portfolio and to explore model-free approaches for determining the VaR.
- Used R to set up binomial tree model and compute implied volatility surface.

#### Are Microloans Too Small?

- The goal is to study how treatment effects of receiving microloans vary across individuals. Random forest was found to outperform other methods in terms of the significance of estimation. A significant heterogeneous treatment effect was found in monthly profits.
- Used R to implement machine learning models, including elastic net, random forest, boosting, and neural net. Tasks involved literature reviews, data cleaning, data visualization, model comparison, and report writing. Amazon Web Service EC2 Instances were set up to speed up analyses.

#### Behind the Shine: Modeling Diamond Prices with Machine Learning
 
- The goal is to find a model with accurate predictions on diamond prices so that customers can avoid being exploited by
retailers. After comparing model performance, bagging generated the lowest prediction error. Diamond size and weight
contribute the most to the price, yet diamond cut quality only has a trivial effect.
- Used R to set up multiple machine learning models. Parameter tuning was performed to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Presented at UIUC Economics Research Symposium.

## Consulting Experience

#### Testing Racial Disparities in Traffic Stops with Veil-of-darkness Method 

- Conducted a veil-of-darkness (VOD) analysis for the Urbana Police Department. VOD refers to the assumption that
police suffer an impaired ability to detect motorists' race. The study focused on traffic stops made during the intertwilight
period, where darkness events were used as the race-neutral benchmark, to test for any existence of racial profiling.
- Conducted literature review on past studies, used R for data preparation and running VOD analysis with logistic
regression.

## Teaching Experience

#### Teaching Assistant - Applied Machine Learning in Economics

- Conducted weekly office hours, managed the online discussion forum, assisted with lab sessions, and evaluated studentsâ€™ project reports.
- Helped students strengthen statistical concepts, programming skills, and report writing skills.
