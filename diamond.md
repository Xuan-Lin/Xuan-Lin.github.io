## Behind the Shine: Modeling Diamond Prices with Machine Learning

The goal is to find a model with accurate predictions on diamond prices so that customers can avoid being exploited by
retailers. After comparing model performance, bagging generated the lowest prediction error. Diamond size and weight
contribute the most to the price, yet diamond cut quality only has a trivial effect. I used R to set up multiple machine learning models and performed parameter tuning to enhance prediction accuracy. This project was presented at the [UIUC Economics Research Symposium](https://economics.illinois.edu/research/undergraduate-research/econ-research-symposium).
